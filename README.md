## End-to-End Regression Project with Flask Web App and deployment in AWS cloud using CI/CD pipelines
### Project Description:
- Successfully initiated the project on GitHub, ensuring efficient version control.
- Developed a structured project setup, including setup.py and requirements.txt files, for seamless deployment and reproducibility.
- Created a robust project structure with clear components and implemented a streamlined data processing pipeline.
- Implemented Exception Handling and Logging Modules to enhance code reliability and debugging.
- Managed data ingestion by reading datasets, performing dataset split into train and test sets, and securely storing them in the artifact folder.
- Implemented data transformation techniques, including handling categorical values and missing data, while ensuring data quality and consistency.
- Utilized standard scaling within data pipelines and saved the resulting pickled transformers in the artifact folder.
- Created the Model Trainer and Model Evaluating components, facilitating model development and evaluation.
- Conducted Model Hyperparameter Tuning using GridSearchCV for optimizing model performance.
- Designed a prediction pipeline integrated into a Flask web application for user-friendly predictions.
- Deployment of the ML application in AWS cloud using CI/CD pipelines
